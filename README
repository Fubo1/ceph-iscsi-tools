This is a top-like to used to show the performance of the rbd images exported
to clients over iscsi. Metrics are sourced from performance co-pilot (pmcd),
aggregated and displayed to the user.

Each exported rbd image is listed, together with the name of the connected
client and associated I/O metrics.
